This Project went a bunch of different ways. First, I started writing javascript files, but I was immediately frusterated with the lack of typescript, and I dipped into the toolchain and installed 'esbuild' to ensure robust, easily linted code was produced in one place, the 'built' directory. Ensuring the entry point and installed TS & eslint was great, but I realized I could build bigger, and more productively, with a tool called Projen.
